      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In Narasimha Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as a
          semi-man, semi-lion in this world.<br /> The king of demons
          (asuras), HiranyaKasyapa, wanted to become immortal and
          wanted to remain young forever.<br /> To this end, he meditated
          for Lord Brahma and because of his severe penance, the
          gods were frightened and asked Brahma to pacify the king.<br /> Brahma was impressed by his
          austerity and granted him a wish.<br /> HiranyaKasyapa wished that he be neither killed by a man
          or beast, nor in daylight or at night and neither inside or outside a building.<br /> Having obtained
          the wish he considered himself the supreme God and forbade all worship of gods by anyone.<br />
          But his son Prahlada, was an ardent devotee of Vishnu.<br /> This enraged HiranyaKasyapa very
          much.<br /> He ordered numerous ways to kill Prahlada including asking his sister Holika to sit
          with Prahlada in the fire.<br /> But everytime Prahlada escaped unhurt.<br /> Enraged, once he asked
          Prahlad to show him the Lord Vishnu.<br /> Prahlad said, "He is everywhere".<br /> Further enraged,
          HiranyaKasyapa knocked down a pillar, and asked if Lord was present there.<p> Lord Vishnu
            then emerged as a half lion, half man from the pillar which was neither inside the house nor
            outside, and the time was evening, neither night nor day.</p> He then killed HiranyaKasyapa
          thus saving the life of his devotee Prahlada.</div>
