          <h4>The Story of BUDDHA Avatar</h4>
        </div>
      </b><br />
      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In BUDDHA Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as BUDDHA, the
          ascetic prince who renounced the throne to lead the world on the path of peace.<br /> He is the
          founder of the BUDDHIST religion prominent across the world.<br /> In certain sects of Hinduism,
          he is considered to be a divine incarnation of Lord Vishnu.<br /> He was born the crown prince of
          the Kapilavastu to Suddhodana and Maya.<br /> He was named Siddhartha, meaning "All thing
          fulfilled" by the king.<br /> But his mother died soon after his birth but Prajapati, the sister of
          Maya, brought Siddhartha up.<br />
          Buddha was saddened by death of living creatures, since his childhood days and used to
          question: "Alas! Do all living creatures kill each other?" He wasn't happy with any answers
          that were provided to him and he decided to find out the meaning and the absolute truth
          and he left his wife and child to a hermit's life in the forest and one day, became the
          enlightened one.<br /> His preaching spawned off the religion of Buddhism now popular across the
          whole world.</div>

      <div style="text-align:center;"><i>In some old Puranas that were written before the start of 1st century i.e.,
          before Christ <b>do-not</b> consider Gauthama aka Siddhartha Buddha as the incarnation of Shree Vishnu.<br />
          But as of now let us consider some of the achievements of Buddha:<br />
          In the start of KaliYuga many many human and animals were sacrifised as a part of ritual practice and
          therefore Shree MahaVishnu incarnation was very much necessary for the installation of peace in Earth,
          and that's what Buddha was always meant to be and he always did just that.<br />
          Buddha was also meant to be as peace-keeper for the people of Earth and that's what Buddha did.
