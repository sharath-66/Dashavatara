          <h4>The Story of VAMANA Avatar</h4>

      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In Vamana Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as a dwarf
          priest in this world.<br /> <b><span>Bali</span></b>, the grandson of <u>Prahlada</u> was a very
          valorous and mighty asura..<br /> By his penance and might, he
          conquered the whole world..<br /> Indra and other gods fearing that
          he and asuras would conquer all the three worlds, went to Lord
          Vishnu for help..<br /> Lord Vishnu was then born as a dwarf Vamana
          in the household of a brahmana (priest)..<br /> He went to Bali on
          growing up and asked for alms..<br /> Bali was delighted to offer him
          anything he requested even though his priest warned him that
          it was Lord Vishnu..<br />
          Vamana then requested for the amount of land that could come
          under his three feet..<br /> Bali gracefully agreed. Lord Vishnu then
          grew in size and covered the earth and heaven in two stride..<br />
          And due to lack of space, he put his third leg on Bali himself
          and crushed Bali to the nether
          or the Patala loka(underground
          world), thus helping the Gods out..</div>

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Analysis:</h4>
      </b>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><i>The incarnation of Vamana can define that if you are a follower of Dharma and
          stands by the Dharma not even the lord can kill you.<br />
          Here Bali, the grandson of Prahlada, though an asura(evil soul) was the follower of Dharma<br />
          So it is obvious that among all the incarnation of lord (except for <a href="01.html">Matsya Avatar</a>, <a
            href="02.html">Kurma Avatar</a> and <a href="09.html">Buddha Avatar</a> where establishment of Human and
          Sura's was most important) was taken to <b> KILL The EVIL</b> <br />
          but in this Avatar he couldn't kill the asura king BALI because he was on the path of Dharma.<br />
          This the Avatar which supports one of if not the most famous shlok ---------> <br />
          <div style="font-size:16px;"><b>"Dharm~Eva Hota Hanti, Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitaha!<br />
              Tasma-Dharmo Na Hantvyo, Ma No Dharmo Hato-Vadhit"</b><br />
            which says <br />
            <b>"Dharma destroys the destroyer; <b>Dharma protects the protector.</b><br />
              Therefore, Dharma doesnot destroy, nor Dharma can be destroyed."</b><br />
          </div>
          <hr>
          <b>
            <h5 style="text-align:center;">Scientific Analysis of the above said shlok</h5>
          </b>
          Eventhough I might seem like I'm going a bit off course but this explanation is very much necessary in-order
          for us to understand any incarnation of the Lord.<br />
          It's explanation when I compare it with Gravitational force is as follows:
          <!--<pre>--><b>
            <p>If Gravitational force is destroyed, everything on earth will fall apart;Gravitational force keeps
              everything protected on earth.<br />
              Neither Gravitational force can be destroyed, nor does Gravitational force destroy.</p>
          </b>
          So it can be seen that Rishi's and Muni's of our ancient time used to respect science
          as the above example stands true as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy">law of
            conservation of energy</a>. And that even the Lord is bound by the physics law.
