          <h4>The Story of VARAHA Avatar</h4>
        </div>
      </b><br />
      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In Varaha Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as a boar in
          this
          world.<br /> A demon Hiranyakashipu, had prayed for Lord Brahma and
          got awarded a boon that no beast nor man nor god could kill him.<br />
          But somehow from the list of beasts the name of boar was missing.<br />
          This proved to be his lacunae.<br /> He then started a campaign of
          plunder across the worlds.<br /> He pushed the world to the Pataal loka,
          or the under of the sea.<br /> He stole the Vedas, the holy scriptures
          from the Lord Brahma, while he was asleep and performed huge
          atrocities.<br /> To retrieve the Vedas and to save the world the Lord
          Vishnu assumed the role of a boar and brought out the earth from
          the under of the ocean, using its two tusks.<br /> It then killed
          Hiranyakashipu and retrieved the Vedas from the asura and
          brought it back to the safe custody of the Lord Brahma.</div>

        <h4><b>Analysis</b></h4><br />
        Guess what Indians were the first among humans who said that the earth is spherical and not flat. Indians didn't
        wait for <strong>Galileo Galilei's</strong> confirmation for it.<br />
        It's shown in this incarnation of Vishnu that earth is actually flat when Lord takes the earth on his
        boar.<br />
        The Pataal Loka here might signify some other dimension maybe.....<br />
        And the ocean that's mentioned here may signify the vast space that's out on the open universe maybe.....<br />
        Or even the space-time fabrication thread that can be bent and modified as per the great scientist's
        (multi-dimensional, extra-terrestrial life form's) wish maybe.....<br />
        And the VARAHA here may signify some form of extra-terrestrial, multi-dimensional life-form that opt to bring
        back Vedas(or the book of knowledge) to help human get some knowledge maybe.....<br />

        <h4>I'm again signifying that:<br />
          All we need to know is Indian Mythological books aren't only pure mythology but has some scientific analysis
          of our past, present and also our future.</h4><br />
        <h4>We can also see some of the greatest inventions of 20th century written in Vedas(books of knowledge)
          thousands of years prior to its invention now, in the western led society.
        </h4> <br />
        <h4><i>This is by NO mean to signify that western society is inferior but to just simply tell that Indian
            ancient books(like Vedas, Puranas) are damn scientific in nature and also a proof of our past. </i>
