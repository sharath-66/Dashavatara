          <h4>The Story of KALKI Avatar</h4>

      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In KALKI Avatar, Lord Vishnu will incarnate himself as
          <b><u><span>KALKI</span></u></b>, the machine-man, who will come riding his <b>white
            horse</b> and with his <b>blazing sword</b> in his hands.<br /> This is
          supposed to be a future avatar of Lord Vishnu.<br /> At the end of
          <u>Kali Yuga</u> (present eon) He will punish all evil doers in this
          world, destroy this world and recreate a golden age(<u> SATHYA Yuga</u>) once again.<br /><br />
          <div>KALKI is the last of the avatars of Lord Vishnu.</div>

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Analysis:</h4>
      </b>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><i>Very little is known with regards to Kalki, his appearance and his
          actions.<br />
          But we can speculate some things nevertheless.<br />
          We can assume that the white horse that the Kalki Bhagavan comes on signifies knowledge maybe.....<br />
          And the sword he blazes signify the growth of science maybe.....<br />
          He could also very well be our successor maybe.....<br />
          He could very well be much advanced than any of us maybe.....<br />
          It is also written in Puranas that Parashuram is alive and will return in Kalki Bhagavan's time as his
          guru<br />
          You will only understand about this point if you have seen or known regarding a very good Hollywood movie <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)"><span
              style="color:yellow;">INTERSTELLAR</span></a><br />
          He(Kalki) could very well be our successor who's also multi-dimentional, and has every laws of this universe
          mastered just like in this movie.<br />
          He could be also the reason why all of Lord Shree MahaVishnu's incarnation took place at the first place just
          like in the movie Interstellar where<br />
          multi-dimentional successor of us has created the warmhole, and took us to other Earth like planet where 5th
          dimentional life form evolves over the time.<br />
          He is said to end the dark age(Kali Yuga).<br />
          The dark age here represents era where we'll lack knowledge and our eon where we'll not be able to keep up
          Dharma.<br /></i>
