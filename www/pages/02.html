        <h4 style="color:#475D12; text-align:center;">The Story of KURMA Avatar</h4>
      </b><br />
      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In Kurma Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as a
          turtle.<br /> It is an interesting story involving both the gods
          (devtas) and asuras (demons).<br /> In the ongoing saga of battle between the gods and asuras,
          on one occasion the gods suddenly lost all their strength due to a curse by the shorttempered
          sage <span style="color:red;">Durvasa</span>.<br /> The sage had once presented a garland of flowers to Indra,
          king of
          gods, who carelessly gave it away to his elephant which trampled it.<br /><br />
          The Devtas approached Vishnu for help.<br /> Vishnu then asked them to churn the ocean of milk
          after adding medicines into the ocean.<br /> <span style="color:red;">Mt Mandara</span> could be used as the
          churning stick he
          said.<br /> He requested them to ask them help of Asuras in lifting the mountain in exchange for
          offer of the share of nectar of immortality that would ensue from the churning.<br /> Both the
          devatas and the asuras churned the ocean using the serpent Vasuki as the rope.<br /> At the
          start, playing a Machiavellian trick, Indra, king of the gods asked the asuras for the head
          end of vasuki. But asuras suspecting foul play, took the head end, only to be deceived as
          the poison from Vasuki was slowly weakening them.<br /> But as churning was proceeding the
          mountain was sinking and then Lord Vishnu took the form of the turtle <b>(<u><span>KURMA</span></u>)</b> and
          kept the
          mountain afloat.<br /> As soon as the bowl of amrita, the nectar of immortality was out, the
          asuras grabbed it.<br /> Then Lord Vishnu took the form of an apsara, <b>Mohini</b> a beautiful maiden, and
          seduced the asuras into letting her distribute the nectar and also to abide by her order of
          distribution. As soon as the devatas were served the maiden disappeared thus totally
          deceiving the asuras and making them totally weak.</div>

      </b>
      <div style="text-align:center;"><i>This incarnation of Lord Vishnu's action says he'll always be by your side no
          matter what happens as long as you are standing there for the cause of Dharma.<br />
          He stood even on Asuras(Evils) side because it is one's duty to stand strong and long even on evils side as
          far as Dharma stands as strong as possible.<br />
          And as far as the nectar of immortality(Amritha) was out he took the incarnation of <b>Mohini</b> to give the
          nectar of immortality(Amritha) for only Suras(devatas aka Good) and hence to make <span
            style="color:#a48e57;">Dharma</span> stand strong.<br />
          <br /><br /> As far as I think here the ocean could have been depiction of the vast space that's out on the
          open universe maybe.....<br />
          Or even the space-time fabrication thread that can be bent and modified as per the great scientist's wish
          maybe.....<br />
