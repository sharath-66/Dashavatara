          <h4>The Story of RAMA Avatar</h4>
        </div>
      </b><br />
      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In Rama Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as Rama, the
          central character in the epic Ramayan.<br /> In the epic, the
          character Rama is expected to show the world the
          characteristics of an ideal person, including ideal son, ideal
          husband, ideal king and an ideal person.<br /> RAMA was incarnated
          upon this planet to get rid of the asura with ten heads, Ravana,
          who had been granted a boon by Brahma of immunity from
          gods, and other celestial beings.<br /> Ravana was too vainglorious
          to be thinking of being vanquished by a man.<br /> Hence RAMA was
          born and Lakshmi, wife of Lord Vishnu was born as Sita, his
          wife to be in this life.<br /> The story of Ramayan, is an exciting nailbiting
          story of the war raged by Rama against various evil
          elements of the world and in the end against Ravana.<br />
          <b>
            <p style="color:Crimson;">Ramayan epitomises the ideal behaviour of man, with special
              focus on man-wife relationship, son-father relationship and the
              rules for ideal governance by a king.</p>

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Analysis:</h4>
      </b>
      <div style="text-align:center;">Here Ramayan, an epic signifies us that however God worshipping you are you'll be
        destroyed if you aren't a follower of Dharma<br />
        In this epic, Ramayan, Ravana was a great worshipper of Lord Shiva,<br /> he had most respected "MAHA
        PATHIVRATA" Mandodhari as his wife,<br />he had many boons from many lords including from Shiva, Brahma to say a
        few,<br />
        He had a huge army<br /> he was the king who had won all the TRILOKA's,<br /> he knew the usage of almost all
        the weapons that existed at that time<br /> and most importantly he was a MAHA BRAHMANA who knew about past,
        present and also future(i.e., He was a TRIKALA Gnani).<br />
        But dispite all of such epitomy he died by the hands of Lord Rama because he had abducted Rama's wife Sita and
        this ultimately led to his destruction.<br />
        Epic Ramayan and Rama Avatar signifies us that --------> <b>we should be very much satisfied by whatever is
          given to us by God, because he gives it for a reason, and we must not feel wanting too much.</b><br />
        Here Ravana couldn't have died if he hadn't had abducted Sita and kept her captivated.<br />
        Ravan was very jealous of Sita's beauty, eventhough he had a very beautiful wife who was also very obedient to
        him.</div>

      <b>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;">Moral Analysis:</h4>
      </b>
      <div style="text-align:center;"> Sita and Hanuman are metaphors for the strength we possess,<br />
        Ravan on the other hand is the metaphor for the weakness we possess,<br />
        And Ram is the balance who doesn't get exited about the strengths he has, who doesn't succumb to the weakness he
        has<br />
        Ram is the balance and all four people are within us only, its our duty to wake up Ram(God) within us.</div>
