          <h4>The Story of PARASHURAMA Avatar</h4>

      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In Parashurama Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as
          a brahmana (priest) in this world.<br /> He was brought in this
          world to avenge all kshatriyas who had become arrogant
          and were suppressing the brahmans in the world.<br /> He was
          born to Jamadagni and Renuka, and belonged to the Brighu
          clan.<br /> Parashurama was always carrying an axe presented to
          him by Lord Shiva of whom he was an ardent devotee.<br />
          Kartavirya Arjuna(also called Sahastra Arjuna) a powerful king and his army, once went to Jamadagni's home,
          was fed with delicious food with offerings from Jamadagni's divine cow Kamadhenu<br />
          The King demanded the cow for the betterment of his subject.<br />
          Jamadagni refused because he needed the cow for his religious ceremonies.<br />
          King Kartavirya Arjuna sent his soldiers to take the cow.<br />
          As the conflict developed Kartavirya lost his cool and chopped off the head of Jamadagni.<br />
          <!--when he was out, and after a
          meal, stole the Kamadhenu cow, which was supposed to give endless quantity of milk.<br/>
          Jamadagni was enraged and he went and killed the king and brought Kamadhenu back.<br/> On
          hearing this, the son of the king came back and killed Jamadagni.<br/>-->
          After hearing the context from his mother(Renuka Devi also considered the incarnation of Shakthi i.e., Durga)
          Parashurama was enraged at this and went and avenged the death of his father killing Kartavirya and also all
          kshatriyas (Kings who were looting common men) in 21 battles.</div>

      <div style="text-align:center;">Not just Asuras(evil soul) the Lord also protects us from other humans who loot
        us.<br />
        The lord is present in one and everybody's soul. That's what is said by Shree Adi Shankaracharya in his Advaita
        Vedanta<br />
        Advaita refers to its idea that the soul(Atma) is the same as the highest metaphysical reality(Brahma).<br />
        Advaita literally mean <strong>"not-two"</strong>.<br />
        Here it can be observed that Parashurama isn't actually Vishnu but a piece of his eternal soul as Parashurama is
        even mentioned in Ramayana and is present in anger when Rama broke ShivaDhanush(the bow of Shiva), and will also
        continue to be till Kalki Avatar where he'll become Kalki's guru and teaches him use of all the weaponary.</div>
