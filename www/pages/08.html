          <h4>The Story of KRISHNA Avatar</h4>

      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In KRISHNA Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as
          KRISHNA , the central character in the epic MAHABHARATA.<br />
          In the biggest epic of Indian mythology a myriad of topics
          are covered, including war, love, brotherhood, politics etc.<br />
          It is essentially the story of two warring groups of cousin
          brothers, the PANDAVAs and the KAURAVAs.<br /> As a part of
          the Mahabharata, during the war KRISHNA, gives a long
          discourse to his disciple ARJUNA, collectively termed as
          Bhagvad-Gita.<br />
          Krishna, during his child-hood was responsible for the killing of Kamsa.<br /> Krishna is also
          considered to be an ultimate playboy who was responsible for charming all gopikaas around
          him.<br /></div>

      <div style="text-align:center;"><i>
          <p>Unlike Ramayan, Mahabharata deals with more down to earth issues like politics, human
            nature, human weaknesses, and does not attempt to idealise the characters as in Ramayan.</p>
          In Mahabharata Shree Krishna is widely known and acknowledged as hero of the whole story of Mahabharata, not
          to mention even in Kurukshethra,<br />
          which was held for the withstandingness of Dharma by the lord Shree Krishna.<br />
          He thought us for the withstandingness of Dharma we may cheat.<br />
          It's also wisely said by Krishna that <span style="font-weight:1000; background-color:yellow;"><b>"EVERYTHING
              IS FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR"</b></span> when he asked Arjuna to kill great warriors like Drona, Karna, Bhishma
          etc unethically.<br />
          It is also believed that all the great weapons used in Kurukshethra are for real and that the weapons are
          nothing but Nuclear weapons.<br />
          It can be seen even in <a
            href="https://www.google.co.in/search?q=kurukshetra&oq=kurukshetra&aqs=chrome..69i57.24303j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8;"><span
              style="background-color:yellow;">Kurukshetra</span></a>, a city in Haryana where Kurukshethra war is
          believed to have been taken place, the land is unfertile,<br />
          which might be due to use of nuclear weapons just like in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
