      <i>
        <div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In Matsya Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as a
          fish
          in this world. In the earliest yuga (era) of Sata-yuga, a king
          named Manu was performing severe penance for thousands
          of years.<br /> One day as he was performing ablutions with river
          water, a small fish came into his hands and just as he was
          about to throw the fish back into the river, the fish
          requested the king to save its life.<br /> Heeding its request, the
          king put the fish into a jar of water but the fish started
          growing and the jar was not big enough for it. Then the
          king threw it into the river, but it soon it outgrew the river
          and the king then threw it into Ganges and then into the
          ocean.<br /> The king realized that it was Lord Vishnu himself and
          then the lord made an appearance and made a special
          request to the king.<br /> It predicted that the world would come
          to an end by a huge flood in seven days and requested the
          king to build a huge boat and take the seven
          sages(hermits), seeds of all plants, one animal of each type
          and told him that he would appear as a fish to propel the
          boat to <b>Mt Himavan</b> for surviving the flood to the next
          yuga(eon).<br /> True to his word, after seven days the Lord
          appeared and the king tied the boat to the fish by using the
          royal serpent Vasuki and the fish took all of them to Mt
          Himavan and kept them there till the flood was over and in
          the new era, the king started procreation for the new era.</div>

      <div style="text-align:center;"><i>This is the ONLY Incarnation which opposes the Darwinism(Charles Darwin's
          theory
          of evolution). though it's supported partly.<br />
          In fact this incarnation supports <span style="font-weight:1000; background-color:yellow;">Dr.Ellis
            Silver's
            conspiracy book titled "Human's are not from earth"</span><br />
          You may observe a pattern here that's : <br />The Earth(or rather to call as "a Planet") was flooded
          by rain
          = a star of Sun's size while dying exhaust all its hydrogen required for fusion and loses its
          property to
          emit light and heat, and once the star is dead its planet also demilishes. This could have been
          shown
          so.....
          Manu's penance = His research on Astronomical science may be.....<br />
          King Manu building a huge boat = A huge artificial satellite may be.....<br />
          King Manu taking seeds of plants, one animal of each type = Bio-preservation to plant in a new land
          may
          be.....<br />
          Vishnu in Matsya Avatar(in the incarnation of a fish) = Rocket used to propel the satellite
          maybe.....<br />
          King Manu's procreation(reproduction) = He going and settling and reproducing in the new planet
          maybe.....</i>

      <b>We can see so many such proofs regarding our origin in Indian mythological books.<br />
        And I'm trying to bring out just about everything one by one.<br />
        All we need to know is Indian Mythological books aren't only pure mythology but has some scientific
        analysis of
        our past, present and also our future.<br />
