				<h3 style="color:#475D12; text-align:center;">The Story of MATSYA Avatar</h3>
			</b><br />
			<i>
				<div style="color:#13414B; text-align:center;">In MATSYA Avatar, Lord Vishnu incarnates himself as a
					fish
					in this world. In the earliest yuga (era) of Sata-yuga, a king
					named Manu was performing severe penance for thousands
					of years.<br /> One day as he was performing ablutions with river
					water, a small fish came into his hands and just as he was
					about to throw the fish back into the river, the fish
					requested the king to save its life.<br /> Heeding its request, the
					king put the fish into a jar of water but the fish started
					growing and the jar was not big enough for it. Then the
					king threw it into the river, but it soon it outgrew the river
					and the king then threw it into Ganges and then into the
					ocean.<br /> The king realized that it was Lord Vishnu himself and
					then the lord made an appearance and made a special
					request to the king.<br /> It predicted that the world would come
					to an end by a huge flood in seven days and requested the
					king to build a huge boat and take the seven
					sages(hermits), seeds of all plants, one animal of each type
					and told him that he would appear as a fish to propel the
					boat to <b>Mt Himavan</b> for surviving the flood to the next
					yuga(eon).<br /> True to his word, after seven days the Lord
					appeared and the king tied the boat to the fish by using the
					royal serpent Vasuki and the fish took all of them to Mt
					Himavan and kept them there till the flood was over and in
					the new era, the king started procreation for the new era.</div>

				<p style="text-align:center;">Analysis:</p>
			</b>
			<div style="text-align:center;"><i>This is the ONLY Incarnation which opposes the Darwinism(Charles Darwin's
					theory
					of evolution). though it's supported partly.<br />
					In fact this incarnation supports <span style="font-weight:1000; background-color:yellow;">Dr.Ellis
						Silver's
						conspiracy book titled "Human's are not from earth"</span><br />
					You may observe a pattern here that's : <br />The Earth(or rather to call as "a Planet") was flooded
					by rain
					= a star of Sun's size while dying exhaust all its hydrogen required for fusion and loses its
					property to
					emit light and heat, and once the star is dead its planet also demilishes. This could have been
					shown
					so.....
					Manu's penance = His research on Astronomical science may be.....<br />
					King Manu building a huge boat = A huge artificial satellite may be.....<br />
					King Manu taking seeds of plants, one animal of each type = Bio-preservation to plant in a new land
					may
					be.....<br />
					Vishnu in Matsya Avatar(in the incarnation of a fish) = Rocket used to propel the satellite
					maybe.....<br />
					King Manu's procreation(reproduction) = He going and settling and reproducing in the new planet
					maybe.....</i></div><br /><br />
			<b>We can see so many such proofs regarding our origin in Indian mythological books.<br />
				And I'm trying to bring out just about everything one by one.<br />
				All we need to know is Indian Mythological books aren't only pure mythology but has some scientific
				analysis of
				our past, present and also our future.<br /></b>
